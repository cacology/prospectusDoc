## Primary Sources

[@Armstrong56:ArtHealth]

> A poem on acquiring health in four books: air, food, exercise, and
> passions. The book mixes advice with classical allusions and seems
> to be aimed at teaching an audience who doesn't have access to folk
> knowledge. It discusses general principles rather than specifics.

Barber, Mary, 1690-1757. [Poems].

> She first wrote verse aiming to improve the minds of children and
> later met Swift along with Grierson, below, and Laetitia
> Pilkington. The three of them were active in Swift's circle. Barber
> was published along with Grierson by Samuel Richardson in 1734, who
> also subscribed. Richardson sent her an early copy of *Pamela*, which
> she comments on.

Butler, Samuel. *Hudibras*. 1663-78.

> Engages all three middle chapters of my dissertation in its satire
> of science and use of poetry and literature as an alternative to the
> Empirical-Baconian project, and deployment of arguments at each
> canto in emulation of Edmund Spenser and *Don Quixote*
> simultaneously.

[@Cervantes14:dq]

> The chapter arguments used by Cervantes in *Don Quixote* have had a
> substantial impact on the development of arguments in English
> literature. Tobias Smollett's translation demonstrates how these
> arguments would have been imagined in the late eighteenth-century.

[@fielding75:tj]

> Well-known for its garrulous narrator and parallel arguments at the
> head of each chapter, Birke---below---cites his earlier work as
> exceptionally useful for understanding arguments. Extending her
> argument to this major text would be an important contribution.

Grierson, Constantia, 1702-32. [Poems].

[@grierson64:print]

> Respected for her classical learning, she studied midwifery with
> Dr. Van Lewen whose daughter Laetitia described her as a "female
> Philosopher" who knew Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French. Mary Barber
> added history, divinity, and philosophy to her list of
> accomplishments. She corrected the press for Terence and
> Tacitus. Eventually becoming a member of Swift's circle, she married
> a printer and wrote a poem on printing.

Lennox, Charlotte. *Female Quixote*. 1752.

> Cited by Birke, below, as an important innovator in the use of
> arguments at the head of chapters. I haven't yet read it, but it
> seems to be critical for the discussion.

[@Locke75:EssayClarendonEd]

[@Locke75:EssaywIntro]

[@Locke90:draftEssay]

> John Locke's philosophy of empiricism motivates the work of the
> Royal Society and becomes the subject of satire for poetry and
> novels. The work was famous nearly immediately and thus the physical
> carriers of the text have been well preserved, helping understand the
> relationship between Locke's intentions, the work of the printers,
> and the visual appearance of the printed text.

[@Mortimer46:Manu]

> Seven heavily revised manuscripts that seem to have served as the
> printer's copy of *Philosophical Transactions* number 486. Some
> portions are marked-out with a line and on a preliminary
> examination, the text that isn't marked out matches the printed
> version and each item is annotated with instructions for
> printing. I'm not certain that this is printer's copy, but if it
> was, it would help understand the printer of the 1746 issue of the
> *Transactions*, Samuel Richardson.

*Philosophical Transactions*. 1665-

> Published from 1665 to the present day, this dissertation focuses on
> the years 1700 to 1752, when publication was taken over by
> committee.

[@sprat58:history]

> An early source explaining the efforts of the Royal Society around
> the time of John Locke's *Essay* and the founding of the
> *Philosophical Transactions*. Sprat was friends with Samuel Butler and
> they traveled together, suggestion some influence.

Swift, Jonathan. *Gulliver's Travels*. 1726.

> In part three, he satirizes the Royal Society and Baconian projects
> with his Lagado Academy. Among the targets are Bishop Wilkins, who
> aimed to develop a language where the symbols corresponded directly
> to objects. His poetry may be useful as well.

## Language History Sources

[@Aarsleff82:LockeSaussure]

> A study of language as intellectual history, comprising of a series of
> interlocking essays with a cohesive introduction to the topic. The
> aim is to trace the lineage of the Saussurian model from Locke,
> Sprat, Mersenne, Bréal, Condillac, Cuvier, Whewell, and Müller among
> others. The argument traces the Adamic model of language---where
> philologist sought to uncover the language of Genesis---to the
> Lockean model that sees a double-conformity between words to ideas
> and ideas to things. The connection between the Locke's late
> seventeenth-century language philosophy to modern semiotics help
> bridge the application of this dissertation to other modern
> concerns.

[@Archibald14:AristLadder]

>  A study of the images and illustrations used in scientific work
>  which relates to the issues of typography, features, and layout in
>  language as well *as* language. It seems important to recognize
>  that images had an important role in developing empirical
>  language. Yet, Archibald's work draws largely on traditions of art
>  history to try to understand the genesis of printed diagrams.

[@birke12:chaptit]

> Discusses so-called chapter titles, which are also called
> "intertitles" by Genette, which don't quite summarize and don't
> quite comment on the chapters that follow. In particular, reads
> Henry Fielding, Sarah Fielding, and Charlotte Lennox as
> practitioners of these titles. I call these "arguments" and think
> that is the correct term in the historical situation. The article
> lays the ground-work for interpreting texts talking about other
> texts within documents.

[@campbell07:enlightenment]

> Explains the standard model for the Enlightenment and an alternative
> model that aims to overcome some of the limitations in the types of
> knowledge possible. The standard model works well, and has worked
> well for centuries, so should not be abandoned, but there are types
> of knowledge it does not accommodate. Gives seven key features of
> the standard Enlightenment model and four types of knowledge not
> included in the standard model: nonpropositional (including poetic),
> personal, social, and local. In particular, it states that ethics
> demands a reassessment of the tools of the Enlightenment.

## Printing History Sources

[@Barchas03:Graphic]

> A key work in the study of the graphical features of the eighteenth
> century novel, which this dissertation is interested in. Barchas
> considers the innovation in layout a crucial piece of the rise of
> the novel and its readership, which bears a useful relationship to
> the language that was developing into that which would be printed in
> the new designs. The book argues that the graphic features of texts
> were read by many as influencing meaning, explicitly rejecting the
> recovery of some Platonic text in favor of bibliographical
> codes. She argues that novels fully adopt those conventions by the
> 1750s and begins to parody them.

> Important recent study builds on both historical and aesthetic
> criticism of type-ornaments. Granjon's were the probable first
> appearance of combinable type ornaments, so the ornaments matter
> for understanding type used in this period, but the methodology
> matters to think about how to record features.

> With these three articles Richard Wendorf explores how

> which "The Secret Life" traces to French influences in English
> typography. The more uniform French faces and design encourage a
> more uniform look, which Wendorf uses to try to understand the
> meaning of the visual features of the typographical face of the
> American Declaration of Independence. Key is his division into "new"
> and "old" style of title-pages, capitalization, and punctuation. He
> identifies a sort of shift in the mid-seventeenth century.

> Discusses recent work in archival history, seeing the research as
> moving from the heady days of critical theory into a recent material
> turn that seeks to integrate the theoretical advances of Derrida and
> Foucault with genuine material knowledge; i.e. the archive seems to
> serve to ground authority, particularly of the state, and can be
> turned to social justice.

[@yeo01:encyc]

> Transactions responds to a need for a comprehensive collection of
> science. This book is a standard in thinking about how dictionary
> makers were in dialogue with the Republic of Letters and the
> dictionary as collaborative project touches on a huge range of
> cultural activities. In unspooling the history of various
> dictionaries and the context in which they arose, the author
> demonstrates the ability to start to ask questions like "why
> dedicate a dictionary to a king?" In essence, a dictionary is not
> quite a commonplace book, but not quite a summary.
